# german-traffic-sign-detection

"maybe.py" is the main python file. here python IDE was used instead of jupyter to avoid errors due to incompatible versions. the complete output of the python program (which includes the prediction of the trained model against the test image "the_one.jpg") named "python_code_output.txt" is included in this repository. Also, in the python program, there is no code to clone the git repository for the training dataset since that was done beforehand and placed in the same directory as the python program
